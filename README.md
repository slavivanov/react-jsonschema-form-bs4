react-jsonschema-form-bs4
=========================

A port of [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) to [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/getting-started/introduction/).

See the [main repository](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form#readme) for documentation.

This version is based on react-jsonschema-form v1.5.0

## Installation

    npm install react-jsonschema-form-bs4

## Usage with Bootstrap 4

Since Bootstrap 4 no longer includes Glyphicons, you need to use [Font
Awesome](https://origin.fontawesome.com/) instead. You can do this by adding
the following to your index.html file:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/css/all.css"
